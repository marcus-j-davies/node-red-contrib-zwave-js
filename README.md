# node-red-contrib-zwave-js
An extremely easy to use, zero dependency and feature rich ZWave node for node-red. Based on ZWave-JS

The implementation is 100% javascript. it is therefore:  
  - Very fast
  - Does not require a build of any static library
  - Stable

Install this node via the Node-Red pallet menu, and you have zwave abilities.  
The node is straightforward to use, and removes all the complexities that you would otherwise need to deal with.

  - Add the node into your flow
  - Select the serial port that represents your USB Zwave radio.
  - Set an encryption key (string or hex array [0x01,0x02]) if you want to use Secure devices.
  - Listen for, and send commands using the node.

**node-red-contrib-zwave-js** is based on  [ZWave-JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/).  
ZWave-JS is actively  maintained, fast and supports the security command class.

## Usage Modes
node-red-contrib-zwave-js, is split into 3 different usage modes.

[Managed](managed.md)  
If you're wanting to get up and running quickly, or not familar with Z-Wave JS, then this is for you.

[Unmanaged](unmanaged.md)   
If you're familar with Z-Wave JS, or a more hardened user, to various z-wave stack implementations, then this may be more usefull.  

GUI  
This mode comes as a node-red UI. It's more for managing your network, but can alter certain values.
just open up the UI tab (on the right)

Whatever your poison, the node will inject the following events, into your flow.

| event                       | node                                | object                          | Meaning                           |

    event: "VALUE_UPDATED",
    timestamp: "23-12-2020T12:23:23+000",
    object: ...
  }
}
```

## Controller based operations
Accessing the UI, will provide you with most of the network management operations.  
But, if you prefer, you can action them via a node message.  
  
The **Controller** class does not require a **node** ID.  

| class                     | operation                           | params                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Controller                | StartHealNetwork                    |                                                       |
| Controller                | StopHealNetwork                     |                                                       |
| Controller                | StartInclusion (see Notes)          | [Bool : Include Non-Secure (optional)]                |
| Controller                | StopInclusion                       |                                                       |
| Controller                | StartExclusion                      |                                                       |
| Controller                | StopExclusion                       |                                                       |
| Controller                | HardReset (see Notes)               |                                                       |
| Controller                | ProprietaryFunc (See Notes)         | [Number : Serial Function ID, Buffer : Data]          |
| Controller                | InterviewNode                       | [Number : Node ID]                                    |
| Controller                | GetNodes                            |                                                       |
| Controller                | SetNodeName                         | [Number : Node ID, String : Node Name]                |
| Controller                | SetNodeLocation                     | [Number : Node ID, String : Node Location]            |

To start Inclusion, you will do.  
```
{
  payload: {
    class: "Controller",
    operation: "StartInclusion",
    params: [true]
  }
}
```

## Notes on StartInclusion  
By default, the include process will only include secure devices, if you want to include non-secure devices, provide a **true** value 

## Notes on HardReset  
A one-way ticket for wiping out all the configuration on the controller.  
Once you call this method, there is no going back - you are hearby **WARNED of the consequences**.  

## Notes on ProprietaryFunc
The **Data** argument, must ONLY contain the data portion of the request  
As an example, this byte array **[0x01, 0x08, 0x00, 0xF2, 0x51, 0x01, 0x00, 0x05, 0x01, 0x51]**  
disables the LED on the GEN 5 Z-Stick, breaking it down we have:  

0x01 - SOF  
0x08 - Total Length  
0x00 - REQ  
0xF2 - Aeotec Set Configuration Function  
0x51 - LED Configuration  
0x01 - Configuration Value Size  
0x00 - Value  
0x05 - ??  
0x01 - ??  
0x51 - Serial API Checksum  

This means we do:

```
/* LED Configuration
 * Configuration Value Size
 * Value
 * ??
 * ??
 */

let _Buf_OFF = Buffer.from([0x51,0x01,0x00,0x05,0x01])
let _Buf_ON = Buffer.from([0x51,0x01,0x01,0x05,0x01])
                                                      
{
  payload:{
    node: 2,
    class: "Controller",
    operation:"ProprietaryFunc",
    params: [0xF2, _Buf_OFF]
  }
}
```

**SOF**, **Total Length**, **REQ** & the **Serial API Checksum** will be provided for you.

# node-red-contrib-zwave-js
An extremely easy to use, zero dependency and feature rich ZWave node for node-red. Based on ZWave-JS

The implementation is 100% javascript. it is therefore:  
  - Very fast
  - Does not require a build of openzwave or any other library
  - Stable

Install this node via the Node-Red pallet menu, and you have zwave abilities.  
The node is straightforward to use, and removes all the complexities that you would otherwise need to deal with.

  - Add the node into your flow
  - Select the serial port that represents your USB Zwave radio.
  - Set an encryption key (if you want to use Secure devices)
  - Listen for, or send commands using the node.

**node-red-contrib-zwave-js** is based on  [ZWave-JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/).  
ZWave-JS is actively  maintained, fast and supports the security command class.

The node operates in 2 ways : **Managed** and **Unmanaged**  

Managed Mode is where the plugin it's self, manages the routing to the correct command class  
and device channel. It is easier to undestand.  

Unmanaged Mode, is where the heavy lifting is done by ZWave-JS, it is a little more involved,  
but Command Class support is only limited by ZWave-JS

## Managed Mode Examples
Encpsulate all your commands within a **payload** object.
```
/* Set a configuration value for a zwave node */

{
  payload:{
    node: 2,
    class: "Configuration",
    operation:"Set",
    params: [0x18, 0x03, 1] // Config Param, Config Value, Value Size
  }
}
```

```
/* Get a configuration value from a zwave node */
/* The result will be injected into your flow */

{
  payload:{
    node: 2,
    class: "Configuration",
    operation:"Get",
    params: [0x18] // Config Param
  }
}
```

```
/* Support for multi-channel devices. i.e Wall sockets with multiple outlets */

{
  payload:{
    node: 2,
    class: "BinarySwitch",
    operation:"Set",
    endPoint:1, // zero based index. 0 - First outlet, 1 - second outlet and so on.
    params: [true]
  }
}
```

```
/* Issue a notification report */

let Report = {
  notificationType: 0x06,
  notificationEvent: 0x16
}

{
  payload:{
    node: 2,
    class: "Notification",
    operation:"SendReport",
    params: [Report]
  }
}
```

## Supported Class/Operation List  
Listed below are the outgoing, Managed CC's that are supported by this node.   
In reality, ZWave-JS supports a much larger range, and you should receive these regadless of the below list.  
i.e you can't interreact with them, but you will still receive the associated events.

The supported CC's within this node, will gradually increase, to mirror what ZWave-JS supports.

## Unmanaged Mode Examples

The combinations in the above table, use a managed approach, that is, the command classes are statically made available via the plugin.  
  
There is another way however, that allows you to target command classes that are not natively supported by the plugin, but are supported by ZWave-JS.  

**setValue**, **getValue** and **getDefinedValueIDs**    

| class                     | operation                           | params                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Unmanaged                 | GetDefinedValueIDs                  | -                                                     | 
| Unmanaged                 | SetValue                            | [ValueID, Value]                                      |
| Unmanaged                 | GetValue                            | [ValueID]                                             |  

The difference with this approach, is that you supply a [ValueID](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/api/valueid)  
The ValueID interface uniquely identifies to which CC, endpoint and property a value belongs to.  
Encpsulate all your commands within a **payload** object.

```
/* Get all ValueID's for a node */
{
  payload: {
    node: 2,
    class: "Unmanaged",
    operation: "GetDefinedValueIDs"
  }
}
```

```
/* Set a value */
/* NOTE : setValue only supports providing 2 params, the ValueID its self, and the value to set. */  
/* ValueID will be one of the ValueIDs returned from GetDefinedValueIDs                          */
{
  payload: {
    node: 2,
    class: "Unmanaged",
    operation: "SetValue",
    params: [ValueID,Value]
  }
}
```

```
/* Get a value */
/* NOTE : using getValue will return the cached value, and may not represent the current value. */
/*        getValue should not be used for poling the device                                     */  
{
  payload: {
    node: 2,
    class: "Unmanaged",
    operation: "GetValue",
    params: [ValueID]
  }
}
```

## Receiving Events

The node will also inject events into your flow, that occur within your zwave network 
The **object** will vary - it depends on the command class that was used in the transmission  
the payload below is also the payload you get when using any of the **Get** operations.
```
{
  payload: {
    node: 2,
    event: "VALUE_UPDATED",
    timestamp: "23-12-2020T12:23:23+000",
    object: ...
  }
}
```

## Controller based operations
The **Controller** class does not require a **node** ID.  

| class                     | operation                           | params                                                |

| Controller                | StopHealNetwork                     |                                                       |
| Controller                | StartInclusion                      | [Bool : Include Non-Secure]                           |
| Controller                | StopInclusion                       |                                                       |
| Controller                | StartExclusion                      |                                                       |
| Controller                | StopExclusion                       |                                                       |
| Controller                | HardReset (see Notes)               |                                                       |
| Controller                | ProprietaryFunc (See Notes)         | [Byte : Serial Function ID, Buffer : Data]            |
| Controller                | InterviewNode                       | [Number : Node ID]                                    |
| Controller                | GetNodes                            |                                                       |


## Notes on HardReset  
A one-way ticket for wiping out all the configuration on the controller.  
Once you call this method, there is no going back - you are hearby **WARNED of the consequences**.  

## Notes on ProprietaryFunc
The **Data** argument, must ONLY contain the data portion of the request  
As an example, this byte array **[0x01, 0x08, 0x00, 0xF2, 0x51, 0x01, 0x00, 0x05, 0x01, 0x51]**  
disables the LED on the GEN 5 Z-Stick, breaking it down we have:  

0x01 - SOF  
0x08 - Total Length  
0x00 - REQ  
0xF2 - Aeotec Set Configuration Function  
0x51 - LED Configuration  
0x01 - Configuration Value Size  
0x00 - Value  
0x05 - ??  
0x01 - ??  
0x51 - Serial API Checksum  

This means we do:

```
let _Buf_OFF = Buffer.from([0x51,0x01,0x00,0x05,0x01]) /*  LED Configuration
let _Buf_ON = Buffer.from([0x51,0x01,0x01,0x05,0x01])   *  Configuration Value Size
                                                        *  Value
                                                        *  ??
                                                        *  ??
                                                        */
{
  payload:{
    node: 2,
    class: "Controller",
    operation:"ProprietaryFunc",
    params: [0xF2, _Buf_OFF]
  }
}
```

**SOF**, **Total Length**, **REQ** & the **Serial API Checksum** will be provided for you.

## Notes on WakeInterval  
When setting the interval, the **Controller Node ID** parameter will almost certainly be 1 - unless you have multiple controllers,
and you want the wake up to be recieved by a different controller. 


## EVENT
The EVENT value should be an object formatted like below.  
```
{
  notificationType: Byte,
  notificationEvent: Byte,
  eventParameters: Buffer (Optional),
  sequenceNumber: Number (Optional)
}
```

## DURATION
The DURATION value should be an object formatted like below.  
```
{
  Duration: {
    value: Number,
    unit: "seconds" | "minutes",
  }
}
```
